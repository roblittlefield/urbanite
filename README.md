A San Francisco law enforcement dispatched calls for service data mapping web app that makes API calls to SF.gov data API endpoints for 911 data. Includes "live" Police data, which is delayed 10 minutes and filtered for sensitive information (juvenile cases, suicide attempts, bomb threats, etc.) and updated every 10 minutes. In practice, it is generally 25-35 minutes delayed. Also uses OpenWeather api for current city weather.
